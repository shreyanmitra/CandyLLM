A simple, easy-to-use framework for HuggingFace and OpenAI text-generation models.

This is a work-in-progress, so pull-requests and issues are welcome! I try to keep it as stable as possible though, so people installing this library do not have any problems. 

If you use this library, please cite Shreyan Mitra.
